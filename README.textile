More information: "Slide Show (S9) Project Site":http://slideshow-s9.github.io.

h2. What's Shower

"Shower":https://github.com/shower is an HTML presentation framework.

h2. Installation

Clone this repository using @git@ and save it in S9's templates directory:

<pre>
$ cd ~/.slideshow/templates
$ git clone https://github.com/avillafiorita/slideshow-shower.git
</pre>

To check if the new template got installed, use the @list@ command:

<pre>
$ slideshow list
</pre>

which should output something like:

<pre>
Installed templates include:
     shower (~/.slideshow/templates/slideshow-shower.js/shower.txt)
</pre>

Now you're ready to use the new template with the @-t/--template@ switch.

Example:

<pre>
  $ slideshow build doc/tutorial.textile -t shower --h2
</pre>

h2. Example and Documentation

Try the following:

<pre>
  $ slideshow -t shower --h2 doc/tutorial.textile
</pre>

and open: "doc/tutorial.html":doc/tutorial.html

h2. Cover

You can declare one or more slides as cover pages.  Cover pages do not have logo nor footer and can show a full-size image.

Use the following code:

<pre>
!SLIDE cover
<span>Your Title</span>
<img src="pictures/ict4g-cover.png" alt="">
</pre>

See the "Ribbon Documentation":https://github.com/shower/shower/wiki/Ribbon for more information. 
*Make sure you do not use @<h1>@ (@<h2>@, if you are using @--h2@) for your title, or slideshow might incorrectly break your slide at the wrong position.*

h2. Personalization

You can use the following data in the front matter of your presentation to control some features of shower:

* @progress: true | false@, to show or hide the progress bar
* @theme: bright | ribbon@, to choose the shower theme
* @logo: url@, to display a logo (50px wide) on the bottom-left corner of the slides
* @footer: text@, to display a footer text on the bottom-left corner

* @css: url@, allows you to customize appearance (@url@ points to a stylesheet)
* remember to prepend your rules with @.slide@.

For instance, to change the color of slide titles to orange use:

<code>
.slide h2 {
    color: orange
  }
</code>

h2. Upgrading Shower
