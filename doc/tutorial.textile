h2. Shower and S9

* this repository is a theme for "s9":https://github.com/slideshow-s9/slideshow based on "shower":https://github.com/shower/shower.
* it makes textile (and markdown) files into shower presentations.

* look at the documentation of s9 to get more information about the structure of input files
* look at the documentation of shower to get more information about how shower works.

h2. Customization

This template supports the following non-standard keywords in the front matter of your presentation:

* @progress: true | false@, to show the progress bar
* @theme: bright | ribbon@, to choose the shower theme
* @logo: url@, to display a logo (50px wide) on the bottom-left corner
* @footer: text@, to display a footer text on the bottom-left corner

h2. Even More

* @css: url@, allows you to customize appearance (@url@ points to a stylesheet)
* remember to prepend your rules with @.slide@.

For instance, to change the color of slide titles to orange use:

<code>
.slide h2 {
    color: orange
  }
</code>
